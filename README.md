# Simon
Put your memory skills to the test with the Firefox clone of a pop culture legend of the '70s and '80s: Simon.

The game features limitless randomly generated pattern sequences that will keep you entertained for hours. It's also programmed with those classic Simon button press sounds that we all remember. Don't like the sounds? No worries, the addon settings allow you to disable game sounds effects.

It's the ultimate time killer, while also improving your memory skills. How many pattern sequences can you remember? Give it a try today!
